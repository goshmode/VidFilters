# Video Filters
Real-time video filters for OpenCV

While it's running, this program will produce a live feed of video from the camera.
	It operates through key presses, and responds to the following keys:
		q = quit
		s = take a screenshot in executable's directory
		n = normal view
		g = gradX filter from tutorial
		e = opencv grayscale
		h = my grayscale
		b = gaussian 5x5
		x = sobel x
		y = sobel y
		m = gradient magnitude
		l = quantized colors
		c = cartoon
		p = pixelated
	  a = High Dynamic Range
	  i = trails/ghosting movements - works best when there is some movement in the frame (hands)
	  u = color shifting
